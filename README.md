## Introduction

This application leverages [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), offering a robust framework that supports server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and incremental static regeneration (ISR). It's optimized for both development and production environments and follows modern best practices for web application development.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up this project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- A package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for version control)

### Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/reshad21/mnseltech-frontend>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or, if you're using yarn, pnpm, or bun:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

### Environment Variables

This project relies on environment variables for configuration. Please create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_API=https://portfolio-backend-beta-roan.vercel.app/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://portfolio-backend-beta-roan.vercel.app/

# Uncomment these lines for local development:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_API=http://localhost:5000/api
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/

NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
```

### Development

Once dependencies are installed and the environment variables are set up, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, using yarn, pnpm, or bun:

```bash
yarn dev
```

```bash
pnpm dev
```

```bash
bun dev
```

The development server will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Production

To test the production build locally, follow these steps:

1. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   Or using yarn, pnpm, or bun:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

   ```bash
   bun build
   ```

2. **Start the production server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or using yarn, pnpm, or bun:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

The production server will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment

The simplest way to deploy a Next.js application is through the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/), created by the developers of Next.js.

To deploy your project:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
3. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js project and deploy it.

For more details, refer to the [Next.js Deployment Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).
